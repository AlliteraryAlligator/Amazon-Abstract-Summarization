# Amazon-Abstract-Summarization

Creates natural summaries, as opposed to extractive summarization, given a series of Amazon product reviews. The model uses the attention mechanism to achieve this.

The model adapts to the lack of grammar and liberal use of misspelt tokens. Amazon reviews are short, making tagging more applicable than an abstract summary. However, this project attempts to summarize several reviews for the same product together to extract commonly recurring, and hypothetically important, pieces of feedback on the product.
